# Mastermind Game

## For the Odin Project - Ruby Programming - Project: File I/O and Serialization

My implementation of the simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) for details on the game.

### The techniques practiced:

Save and load the game using YAML
Reading data from text files
String manipulation
